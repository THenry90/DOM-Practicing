# DOM-Practicing

This is a Web page to help with DOM practicing elements.

The main aim is to understand enough so that I can take user input and add more to a webpage.

It will serve as the bulding blocks for my productivity task tracker app.

First stage:

Looking at HTML input options.

Including text input, Date and time pickers, Checkboxes, Forms, buttons and dropdowns. Fairly Self explanatory - but to track tasks we need ways of inputing the tasks.

I thought I would need to create a JS nuber picker from scratch to display the correct minutes and seconds on an input form. Turns out there is inbuilt HTML that does this for you already.

Second Stage: Time and Date Display

Next stage is getting a working clock - thids way when we require a calculation 0 such as 25 minutes from NOW (like in a pomodoro timer) - we have the pre-requisite JS code to start from.

First aspect of DOM manipilation -
JS code to calculate the date and time.
DOM manipulation to display this result on screen
More JS code to update the page every second.

Thirds stage:

Combining different inputs - text box and check box
